# FAQ

## How long are files stored on the platform?

Files are removed from the list around 24 hours after adding it. Although, it may take longer for the files to be removed from all storage backends.

## Where are my files stored?

They are stored in one of several storage backends - including IPFS and web3.storage.

## Are my files private?

No. Well, not yet at least. The files currently uploaded to Shiro Share will all be public. Although, to retrieve them you will need the CID - which can currently only be obtained by you (the user) and the node operators.

It is possible to encrypt these files such that they can only be viewed from the special share link. This feature is not yet implemented.
